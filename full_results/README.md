# Full Results Tables

We recommend compiling the results table markdown files for best viewing. An easy
way to do this is to view the tables on GitHub, in your browser: 
[url](https://github.com/egolf-cs/scythe-fmcad2024/tree/main/full_results).

We ran experiments with about 700 distinct sketches. Those results are shown in
[./all_experiments.md](./all_experiments.md). We also ran all experiments in
Table I five times and reported the data point with the best time (as if we ran
all five runs in parallel and halted when one thread finished). Those results
are shown in [./five_runs.md](./five_runs.md); refer to the init_configid column
for the ID that matches Table I.
